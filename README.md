# mmtf-proteomics
Under construction: Methods for mapping proteomics data onto 3D protein structure.

A few example Jupyter Notebooks are available for testing and feedback.

* S_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb: Maps S-sulphenylation data to 3D structure
* QueryDbPTM.ipynb: Query the dbPTM database and map PTMs to 3D structure
* BrowseDbPTM.ipynb: Browse dbPTM database by PTM type and mapt to 3D structure

To try out our example Jupyter Notebooks with no installation, click on the launch binder button below. Once Binder is launched (this may take a few minutes), navigate to the mmtf_proteomics/analysis directory and launch any of the notebooks.

Please create a [issue](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/issues) to provide feedback or request new features.

We are looking for interesting new datasets to map onto 3D structure.
