# mmtf-proteomics
Methods for mapping proteomics data onto 3D protein structure.

A few example Jupyter Notebooks are available for testing and feedback.

* [CysOxydationTo3DStructure.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master?filepath=mmtf_proteomics%2Fanalysis%2FCysOxydationTo3DStructure.ipynb): Map S-Sulphenylation and S-Sulfinylations in A549 and HeLa cell lines to 3D structure
* [S_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master?filepath=mmtf_proteomics%2Fanalysis%2FS_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb): Map S-sulphenylation data to 3D structure
* [QueryDbPTM.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master?filepath=mmtf_proteomics%2Fanalysis%2FQueryDbPTM.ipynb): Query the dbPTM database by UniProt Id, UniProt Name, or PDB/Chain Id  and map PTMs to 3D structure
* [BrowseDbPTM.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master?filepath=mmtf_proteomics%2Fanalysis%2FBrowseDbPTM.ipynb): Browse dbPTM database by PTM type and map to 3D structure

## Instructions how to use the Jupyter Notebooks
These Jupyter notebooks run in your web browser without software installation using [Binder (beta)](https://mybinder.org/), an experimental platform for reproducible research (The Binder servers can be slow or may fail).

After you click on a notebook link above, you see a spinning Binder logo. Wait until the notebook launches (this may take a few minutes).

When the notebook has launched, click the ">>" button and then choose: "Restart and Run All Cells". Wait until the notebook runs to the end (this may also take a few minutes). Then you can view PTMs mapped onto 3D structures at the bottom of the notebook.

Use the slider to browse through the structures.

Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to rotate a structure.
