# mmtf-proteomics
Under construction: Methods for mapping proteomics data onto 3D protein structure.

A few example Jupyter Notebooks are available for testing and feedback.

* S_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb: Map S-sulphenylation data to 3D structure
* QueryDbPTM.ipynb: Query the dbPTM database by UniProt Id, UniProt Name, or PDB/Chain Id  and map PTMs to 3D structure
* BrowseDbPTM.ipynb: Browse dbPTM database by PTM type and map to 3D structure

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master) to run life Jupter Notebooks in your web browser without software installation.

Launching the Binder server may take a few minutes. [Binder (beta)](https://mybinder.org/) is an experimental platform for reproducible research, so it may not always work.

Then navigate to the mmtf_proteomics/analysis directory and launch any of the notebooks.

Please send feedback or feature requests](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/issues).
